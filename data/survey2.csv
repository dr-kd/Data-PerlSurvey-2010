This is particularly important for our company, because end users are often unable to install CPAN modules either because they lack technical ability or because of organisational policies. Thus, we need to stick with what ActiveState ships by default on Windows, or include the relevant installation packages on a CD (which then leads to many support requests, because the modules need to be installed in a certain order after ActivePerl but before our product...). This is less of a problem with Debian or RHEL based Linux distributions, though even in those installing modules from CPAN often has to be done manually bypassing the package manager.[CR]","Highly pragmatic, sometimes inelegant",3,3,"If it's certification for certification's sake (i.e. putting it on your CV to compete with other certification names in the job market), then no.

While I am far less often able to find a canned solution in other languages, it is more common to find a near-canonical specific, usually very well supported and maintained package to address some common needs (e.g. Python's SciPy, Java's WEKA).  This is not to say that there are not fine solutions available for Perl, only that it can be harder to identify which ones they are, and whether they've seen no updates in years because they are actually that stable, or because the author lost interest in maintaining the package.",expressive free fast fun,5,6,"Generally speaking, I'm skeptical of the value of such certifications.

Its regexes. I highly value perl for how quickly I can write useful unix oneliners/scripts.,"I think perl's object support is laughable. it is annoying to write, inflexible, and formally just backwards. it makes writing modern, reusable code nigh on impossible (at least in the way that every other OO language does it).[CR][CR]I find the perl community to be insular and hostile to other languages. At YAPC, there was definitely some Haskell and Ruby love, but by and large I get the sense that inside the perl community it's ""us v. them"" where them is usually Python or PHP. The people in the perl community I hear this from just come off, then, as being religious about their language.[CR][CR]Perl's implementation is incredibly ad-hoc and unformalized. Even now, in 5.12, 23 years after perl's birth, it feels like some hacked-together scripting language. This is awkward, to say the least. What am I referring to? OO, the vagaries of param/arg patterns in core functions, sigils, context-sensitive evaluation, putting a true value at the end of a module (ridiculous, especially for learning programmers), packaging modules, the lack of a robust, well-supported interactive interpreter, lack of actual function parameters, having to ""use strict; use warnings"" at the top of every file, EXPORT_OK (nuff said).[CR][CR]I write Perl because that's what my company writes. But over time here I've learned to strongly disfavor it--I'd eagerly write Python or Ruby any day (Less so PHP--but hey, at least it has actual classes). As a computer scientist I'm annoyed by how informal perl is and as a hobby/career programmer I'm annoyed at how the language works against me when trying to write extensible, reusable code.[CR][CR]And don't tell me to go install Moose--I tried.

The closures are useful and well designed. The quote-like operators can make certain strings/regexes more readable.[CR][CR]It's better than shell-scripting.[CR],"Perl's core has almost no abstraction: It's a pain to create a class with the same interface as a builtin datatype. Operator overloading is experimental and index/key lookups require additional tying. It lacks a good notion of iterators (and generators), so you can't use foreach to loop over a dynamically generated dataset (or one too large to fit in memory). By default exceptions are strings rather than classes (likewise subroutine attributes are strings). Each data structure has a radically different syntax (even arrays and hashes have different sytaxes for index/key loopup). There's not a good way to generally test if something is a subclass of another: UNIVERSAL::isa($x,'Class') is discouraged and $x->isa('Class') dies if $x isn't blessed, so you end up having to do a lot of overly-complicated checking for simple things. Perl exposes the underlying implementation of its strings and confuses them with series of bytes (a string should just be a list of codepoints). The POSIX library actually expected me to bit-pack binary structures according to the C calling conventions rather than serializing datastructures itself. In fact tons of core perl libraries expect the user to bit-twiddle rather than provide sensible high-level interfaces. Etc, etc... too many missing abstractions to think of. Even C++ does a significantly better job of abstracting things than perl.[CR][CR]Perl is horribly crufty: The set of reserved/magic variables is large, but there's no naming convention prevent conflicts with users' variables/functions. Supposedly you're safe if you avoid UPPERCASE_NAMES (yet you're encouraged to use that for constants), except for various things like import(). Everything is named inconsistently (eg, can() vs. DOES()). Most features have some kind of weird exception to the rules (often they're intended to be helpful, but they end up forcing me to add more special cases to my own code). I'm under the impression it's not even really possible to lex perl.[CR][CR]Perl relies on global state to a ridiculous extent, making it easy for different pieces of code to accidentally trip each other up. The vast majority of things in perlvar shouldn't be global (IO::Handle methods are good, but $. and $/ shouldn't exist). Mapping/grepping relies on the global variable $_, which breaks as soon as you're filtering through a function that inadvertently sets $_. Similar things go for regexes, etc.[CR][CR]The ""helpful"" implicit behaviors have been a constant source of unnecessary, hard-to-find bugs, like the joy of discovering that the innocent-looking grep( {$_} @UNCHANGING_HASH{@keys} ) modifies the hash due to a lovely combination of aliasing and autovivification (although that taught me the usefulness of Readonly, such a bug never would have occurred in a well-designed language). Perl rarely does what I mean, I feel like it only does what Larry Wall means.[CR]",unabstracted crufty insecure corner-cases,,4,,DBIx::Class,HTML::Expr,CGI,LWP,DateTime,6,5,4,4,1,,completed,"['start','PAGE_000','PAGE_001','PAGE_002','PAGE_003','PAGE_004','PAGE_005','PAGE_005a','PAGE_006','PAGE_007','PAGE_008','PAGE_009','PAGE_010','PAGE_011','last','completed']"

A potential employer can ask a prospective employee their CPAN ID and go read their code / the bugs they've reported and fixed. This has the added benefit of being autonomously contemporaneous. Static certification tests can only cover a finite spectrum of the technical gamut that is Perl. CPAN and rt.cpan.org participation demonstrate technical prowess and also soft skills, such as project management and ability to work in a remote team setting. These cannot possibly be assessed by a certification but are at least as important for employers as the technical skills a certification would cover.

Perl's respect for convenience, such as making parentheses optional around subroutine arguments (that are predeclared), and 'say', the best string interpolation besides Perl6. A well done library use and namespace importing interface. The design of the language keeps boilerplate code down. Easy introspection. Built in scalar, arrays, and hashes, and the interface to use them are complete and easy to use. The sub argument passing interface is very open ended and powerful. I use one liners all the time.

[CR][CR]Also, it kind of sucks that there is no GREAT solution to run Perl on a webserver on Windows; mod_perl and mod_ssl in combination don't work, mod_perl and Strawberry does not work (only with Activestate because of compiler incompatibilities), finding out how to run FastCGI on IIS is tedious to say the least, well, you know.",completed,"['start','PAGE_000','PAGE_001','PAGE_002','PAGE_003','PAGE_004','PAGE_005','PAGE_005a','PAGE_006','PAGE_007','PAGE_008','PAGE_009','PAGE_010','PAGE_011','last','completed']"
