A potential employer can ask a prospective employee their CPAN ID and go read their code / the bugs they've reported and fixed. This has the added benefit of being autonomously contemporaneous. Static certification tests can only cover a finite spectrum of the technical gamut that is Perl. CPAN and rt.cpan.org participation demonstrate technical prowess and also soft skills, such as project management and ability to work in a remote team setting. These cannot possibly be assessed by a certification but are at least as important for employers as the technical skills a certification would cover.

We know, because of network effects, who's got the chops. So, the purpose of certification and accreditation is for business acceptance (risk management, etc.). Perl is at a critical point in its ""life"" where its reputation with the majority of business programming environments is waning (or never even got a mention).
