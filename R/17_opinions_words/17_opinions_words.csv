"833","That there's more than one way to do it.","As a language, Perl rarely frustrates me (usually the opposite, in fact).  Due to its size and the uncertain state of some packages, I think CPAN can be a frustrating experience.  That's not a fault of Perl, and only partially a fault of CPAN (after all, the package maintainers have to bear much of the responsibility for users' experience of their contribution), but it is a little frustrating.  While I am far less often able to find a canned solution in other languages, it is more common to find a near-canonical specific, usually very well supported and maintained package to address some common needs (e.g. Python's SciPy, Java's WEKA).  This is not to say that there are not fine solutions available for Perl, only that it can be harder to identify which ones they are, and whether they've seen no updates in years because they are actually that stable, or because the author lost interest in maintaining the package.","expressive free fast fun"

OO, the vagaries of param/arg patterns in core functions, sigils, context-sensitive evaluation, putting a true value at the end of a module (ridiculous, especially for learning programmers), packaging modules, the lack of a robust, well-supported interactive interpreter, lack of actual function parameters, having to ""use strict; use warnings"" at the top of every file, EXPORT_OK (nuff said).[CR][CR]I write Perl because that's what my company writes.

It takes a number of modules, some of them third-party and questionable (autobox), to really make Perl OO throughout.  Modern::Perl is a good start, but things like classic class support should really be baked right in; it's hard to bolt Moose onto an existing project, especially when performance is a concern.  One of the things that I first really enjoyed about Python was how cheap and dead simple it is to create classes.[CR][CR]A lot of introductions to Perl still don't use best practices.

The quote-like operators can make certain strings/regexes more readable.[CR][CR]It's better than shell-scripting.[CR]","Perl's core has almost no abstraction: It's a pain to create a class with the same interface as a builtin datatype. Operator overloading is experimental and index/key lookups require additional tying. It lacks a good notion of iterators (and generators), so you can't use foreach to loop over a dynamically generated dataset (or one too large to fit in memory). By default exceptions are strings rather than classes (likewise subroutine attributes are strings). Each data structure has a radically different syntax (even arrays and hashes have different sytaxes for index/key loopup). There's not a good way to generally test if something is a subclass of another: UNIVERSAL::isa($x,'Class') is discouraged and $x->isa('Class') dies if $x isn't blessed, so you end up having to do a lot of overly-complicated checking for simple things. Perl exposes the underlying implementation of its strings and confuses them with series of bytes (a string should just be a list of codepoints). The POSIX library actually expected me to bit-pack binary structures according to the C calling conventions rather than serializing datastructures itself. In fact tons of core perl libraries expect the user to bit-twiddle rather than provide sensible high-level interfaces. Etc, etc... too many missing abstractions to think of. Even C++ does a significantly better job of abstracting things than perl.[CR][CR]Perl is horribly crufty: The set of reserved/magic variables is large, but there's no naming convention prevent conflicts with users' variables/functions. Supposedly you're safe if you avoid UPPERCASE_NAMES (yet you're encouraged to use that for constants), except for various things like import(). Everything is named inconsistently (eg, can() vs. DOES()). Most features have some kind of weird exception to the rules (often they're intended to be helpful, but they end up forcing me to add more special cases to my own code). I'm under the impression it's not even really possible to lex perl.[CR][CR]Perl relies on global state to a ridiculous extent, making it easy for different pieces of code to accidentally trip each other up. The vast majority of things in perlvar shouldn't be global (IO::Handle methods are good, but $. and $/ shouldn't exist). Mapping/grepping relies on the global variable $_, which breaks as soon as you're filtering through a function that inadvertently sets $_. Similar things go for regexes, etc.[CR][CR]The ""helpful"" implicit behaviors have been a constant source of unnecessary, hard-to-find bugs, like the joy of discovering that the innocent-looking grep( {$_} @UNCHANGING_HASH{@keys} ) modifies the hash due to a lovely combination of aliasing and autovivification (although that taught me the usefulness of Readonly, such a bug never would have occurred in a well-designed language).
